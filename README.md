# Python HTTP Server Project

## Project Description
For this project, I built a simple HTTP server using Python. The server was designed to handle basic HTTP requests and responses, serving static files, and providing a foundation for more advanced web application development.

## Key Components

1. **Socket Programming**:
   - Used Python's `socket` module to create the server.
   - Listened on a specific port for incoming HTTP requests.
   - Handled TCP connections and communication between the server and clients.

2. **Request Handling**:
   - Parsed incoming HTTP requests to determine the requested resource.
   - Implemented basic routing to serve different types of content based on the request URL.
   - Supported methods like GET and POST.

3. **Serving Static Files**:
   - Used file I/O to read and serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) from the server's directory.
   - Implemented MIME type detection to correctly serve different file types.

4. **Response Generation**:
   - Constructed HTTP response headers and bodies.
   - Managed status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
   - Sent responses back to the client through the socket connection.

## What I Learned

1. **Fundamentals of Networking**:
   - Gained a deeper understanding of how TCP/IP and HTTP protocols work.
   - Learned about client-server communication and the role of sockets in network programming.

2. **HTTP Protocol**:
   - Familiarized myself with the structure of HTTP requests and responses.
   - Learned about different HTTP methods and status codes.

3. **File Handling in Python**:
   - Improved my skills in file I/O operations in Python.
   - Learned how to read, write, and serve files dynamically based on client requests.

4. **Debugging and Error Handling**:
   - Developed strategies for debugging network-related issues.
   - Implemented error handling for common issues like missing files and malformed requests.

5. **Scalability and Performance**:
   - Explored ways to optimize the server for better performance and scalability.
   - Learned about multi-threading and asynchronous programming to handle multiple client connections efficiently.

6. **Practical Application of Python**:
   - Applied Python programming skills to build a functional, real-world application.
   - Improved my understanding of
