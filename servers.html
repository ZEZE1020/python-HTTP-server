  <h1>Introduction to Servers and HTTP</h1>

  <h2>What are Servers?</h2>
  <p>Servers are computers or systems that provide resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as
    clients, over a network. Servers can serve various functions, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Host websites and serve web pages to clients.</li>
    <li><strong>File Servers:</strong> Store and manage files for network users.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Servers:</strong> Provide database services to other computers or applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Application Servers:</strong> Run specific applications for client computers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Servers play a crucial role in networked computing environments, allowing multiple clients to access shared
    resources efficiently.</p>

  <h2>What are HTTP Servers?</h2>
  <p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) servers are servers that communicate over the web using the HTTP protocol. HTTP
    servers handle requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serve web pages or other resources in response.
    Here’s how an HTTP server works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The client (web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server.</li>
    <li>The server processes the request and retrieves the requested resource (e.g., an HTML page, image, or file).</li>
    <li>The server sends an HTTP response back to the client, including the requested resource.</li>
    <li>The client displays the resource to the user.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS Servers</h2>
  <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) servers are HTTP servers that use encryption to secure data transfer.
    The main differences between HTTP and HTTPS are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTP is unsecured, while HTTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transfer
      between the client and server.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> HTTPS ensures that the data sent between the client and server is not tampered
      with during transit.</li>
    <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> HTTPS provides confidentiality by encrypting the data, making it unreadable to
      unauthorized parties.</li>
    <li><strong>SSL Certificate:</strong> HTTPS requires a valid SSL certificate, which verifies the identity of the
      website and enables secure connections.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using HTTPS is essential for protecting sensitive information, such as login credentials, payment details, and
    personal data, transmitted over the web.</p>

  <h2>Creating Python HTTP Servers</h2>
  <p>You can create a simple HTTP server in Python using the built-in <code>http.server</code> module. Here’s a
    step-by-step guide:</p>

  <h3>Step 1: Import the Required Modules</h3>
  <p>First, import the necessary modules:</p>
  <pre><code>import http.server
import socketserver</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 2: Define the Port and Handler</h3>
  <p>Next, define the port number and the request handler:</p>
  <pre><code>PORT = 8000
Handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler</code></pre>

  <h3>Step 3: Create and Start the Server</h3>
  <p>Create the server using the <code>socketserver.TCPServer</code> class and start it:</p>
  <pre><code>with socketserver.TCPServer(("", PORT), Handler) as httpd:
    print("Serving at port", PORT)
    httpd.serve_forever()</code></pre>
  <p>This code creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8000 and serves files from the current directory. To run the
    server, save the code to a file named <code>server.py</code> and execute it using Python:</p>
  <pre><code>python server.py</code></pre>
  <p>Once the server is running, you can access it in your web browser by navigating to
    <code>http://localhost:8000</code>.</p>

  <h2>How HTTP Servers Work</h2>
  <p>Here’s a detailed explanation of how HTTP servers work:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Client Sends Request:</strong> The client (e.g., a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server.
      This request includes the method (e.g., GET, POST), the URL, headers, and optionally a body.</li>
    <li><strong>Server Processes Request:</strong> The server receives the request and processes it. It determines the
      requested resource, checks permissions, and performs any necessary operations (e.g., querying a database).</li>
    <li><strong>Server Sends Response:</strong> The server generates an HTTP response, which includes a status code
      (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers, and the body (e.g., HTML content, images). The server sends this response
      back to the client.</li>
    <li><strong>Client Renders Response:</strong> The client receives the response and renders the content. For web
      pages, this includes displaying the HTML, applying styles, and executing scripts.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent, and the server does not retain information about
    previous requests. This simplicity makes HTTP efficient and scalable but requires additional mechanisms (e.g.,
    cookies, sessions) to maintain state between requests.</p>
